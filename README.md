## Understanding of the Algorithm

If you want more details, you can look at [this page](https://medium.com/@springboard_ind/knn-machine-learning-algorithm-explained-596d60336076).

This classification Algorithm was used during a competition in my school to predict unknown data.

I used the euclidian distance on my normalized data to find the k-nearest individuals. Then, I simply assign the most represented class to the data that we are predicting. The confusion matrix was also useful to understand how good my code is.

I also plotted how efficient was my algorithm depending on the number k to optimize it.
